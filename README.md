## **Repository Name**: `RealTime Virtual Assistant`

## Overview

**RealTime Virtual Assistant** is a cutting-edge AI-driven solution designed to assist customers in real-time by guiding them through product documentation. The assistant interacts with users through a screen-sharing interface and uses **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** to answer customer queries by referring to relevant product documents.

The core of the system leverages a **FastAPI-based backend** that integrates optical character recognition (OCR), document retrieval, and large language models (LLM) for intelligent response generation. This makes it ideal for use cases where users need to quickly find answers while interacting with product documentation during a support or troubleshooting session.

## Use Case

In this scenario, customers share their screen with the virtual assistant while seeking help for a specific problem. The assistant analyzes the screen content (e.g., error messages, UI elements) and uses RAG to retrieve relevant product documentation, guide the user step-by-step, and provide contextually accurate solutions.

### Features

- **Screen Sharing & OCR Integration**: The assistant processes shared images/screenshots and extracts relevant text or keywords using OCR technology.
- **Product Documentation Reference**: Using the RAG framework, the assistant dynamically retrieves relevant sections of product documentation.
- **Real-Time Guidance**: The assistant generates detailed, human-like responses to assist users, drawing from the knowledge base of product documentation.
- **FastAPI Interface**: The backend provides a RESTful API for seamless communication between the virtual assistant and the system.

## How it Works

The system follows a modular architecture, ensuring scalability and flexibility. Here’s an overview of the components involved:

### **1. Input Layer**
- **OCR for Image/Text Extraction**: The system processes the shared screen images/screenshots and extracts text using OCR technology such as Tesseract or AWS Textract.

### **2. Retrieval Layer**
- **Document Retrieval**: The assistant uses a combination of dense and sparse retrieval methods (using tools like FAISS and Elasticsearch) to search product documentation for relevant content.

### **3. Reader Layer**
- **Response Generation with LLM**: Once relevant documents are retrieved, the assistant uses a large language model (LLM) like GPT or Hugging Face to generate a user-friendly response to the customer query.

### **4. Orchestration Layer**
- **FastAPI Backend**: A FastAPI-based backend orchestrates the system's workflow, handling user queries, document retrieval, and response generation.

### **5. Parser Layer**
- **Frontend Interaction**: The system supports to convert LLM response to HTML RTF format

### 1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/realTime-virtual-assistant.git
cd realTime-virtual-assistant
```

### 2. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r rag_framework/requirements.txt
```

### 3. Run the FastAPI backend:

```

### 4. Dockerize the application (optional):

To containerize the application, build and run the Docker containers:

```bash
docker build -t realTime-virtual-assistant .
docker run -p 8000:8000 realTime-virtual-assistant
```

---

## Deployment

You can deploy **RealTime Virtual Assistant** on cloud platforms like **AWS**, **Google Cloud**, or **Azure**, using **Kubernetes** for orchestration. Docker Compose can also be used for local development.

1. **Cloud Deployment**: Follow the respective cloud platform's deployment instructions for FastAPI, Docker, and Kubernetes.
2. **Local Deployment**: Use Docker Compose for running all services locally, including the FastAPI backend and database.

---

## Testing

Unit tests and integration tests are included in the repository to validate the functionality of each layer.

Run the tests using `pytest`:

```bash
pytest rag_framework/tests/
```
